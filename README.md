# Neural Network Lesson

A notebook that is meant to teach people how to understand, design, and create neural networks. Goes over history, forward pass, backpropagation, gradient descent, optimizers, regularization techniques, and hyperparameters, as well as theory.

## Setup
---

Ensure that you have some sort of python environment installed. Also make sure you have git installed. You can go [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) to install git.

  - **Step 1**: Create a folder you want the file to be.
  - **Step 2**: Open your command line of choice (powershell, cmd, mac alternatives, linux, etc.)
  - **Step 2**: Navigate to your folder with ```cd yourFolderName```
  - **Step 3**: Initialize your repository with ```git init```
  - **Step 4**: Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/PatrickErickson4/NeuralNetLesson.git```
  - **Step 5**: Install the dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Starting out
---
  - **Step 1**: Open InteractivesAndModels
  - **Step 2**: Click on the tutorial and look through it if you want to implement it yourself!
  - **Step 3**: Check out how well the model generalizes to new data by running driver.py! (It does poorly lol)
