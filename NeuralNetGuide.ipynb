    "Neural Networks have been gaining a lot of traction in the world as of recent, with the rise of giant models such as Chat-GPT and other LLMs. While the complexity of these giant AI models can not be explained by neural networks alone, they make up a core part of what makes them function. Furthermore, there are thousands of other types of models that use neural networks in their architecture to help them make predictions. In this document, I will be detailing the reason and intuition behind neural networks, the math behind them, including how to forward pass, activation functions, regularization techniques, and backpropagation (if you don't know what these mean, don't worry. We'll cover it!), and more complex stuff such as optimization functions. Lastly, I will go over an in-depth analysis on my own Neural Network's architecture so you can see my own intuitions behind the construction of one, from scratch without the use of popular libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. This article does assume, however, that you have a basic understanding of classification and regression. For the scope of this document, we will not be delving into Convolutional Heads or Time Series.\n",

    "### A Brief History of Neural Networks: The Perceptron\n",
    "The birth of the Neural Network had much humbler beginnings than the giant models we see today. [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt), at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, had constructed something called a single layer perceptron simulated on an IBM 704 in 1957. This \"perceptron\" was made to simulate an individual neuron within the human brain, which either fires or doesn't fire based on the input it's given. \n",

    "  - Properties Owned\n",

Fer example, the income and the number of properties owned aren't over a certain threshold, we would print 0, for being not rich. Likewise, if income and and property value aren over this threshold, we then predict 1 (rich). More specifically, the algorithm looks at all of the points it misclassifies and then performs an operation to move the hyperplane to fix that misclassification. This algorithm continues to do this until all points are satisfied. We can visualize how the perceptron works with the following simulation:"

We can therefore \"linearly seperate\" the data to make our predictions, which is the whole basis on how perceptrons work. However, what if the data isn't linearly seperable? For example, there could be some people who are considered \"rich\" who may only have one property, but that one property is a skyscraper in Manhattan worth billions. Our perceptron doesn't have this information, and we may not necessarily know this information to be able to put it into the perceptron. This \"unexplained data\" may cause our dataset to look more like this simulation, and is more analagous to the real world:"

This issue only gets worse for datasets where linear seperability is borderline impossible. However, we can see that the data is still approximately linearly seperable, which allows us to be able to use methods such as logistic regression and other machine learning techniques will do a pretty good job of predicting the overall overall dataset, especially in the case we just described.

It can be said that if a customer does not visit the online or real store, then the customer will not buy the product, because they are not interested. Likewise, a customer will most likely not walk out with anything if they visit both the online and real store, because they are currently assessing their options and they will not make a hasty decision on buying the product. However, if a customer visits the online store but not the real store, the customer may be more likely to buy it because they may think it's cheap and convenient. Likewise, a customer might be more enticed to buy a product if they physically saw it at the real store, but did not think to compare online, since the enticing prospect of buying and immediately having it is really high.

    "As we expected, the perceptron performs extremely poorly. This phenomenon itself led to one of the biggest AI winters ever since the conception of the perceptron, slowing AI research to a near standstill for 20 years. However, this obviously does not pertain to today, as we have figured out a clever workaround for this issue. This, along with stochastic nature of the perceptron algorithm, did not specify loss efficiently, and would therefore oscillate with no real solution. In Layman's terms, the perceptron had no \"confidence\" in its decisions, based on the distance a point was from the classifying boundary.\n",

    "The Universal approximation theorem ultimately states that combining multiple linear segments into one unified classification output can approximate any function, given enough perceptrons. This groundbreaking revelation in 1989 spurred the idea of stacking and adding up the effects of all of the inputs together in one \"layer\" to be able to finally classify non-linear decision boundaries, like the XOR problem we had described above. The idea of using the \"confidence method\" as I had described as an output head had also given rise to solving the issue of the perceptron jumping around everywhere and never converging. This new misclassification minimization required gradient descent, and round this time as well. a new algorithm called backpropagation was developed. Backpropagation efficiently calculates the chained derivatives of the hidden layer for gradient descent, so now the perceptrons weights could be tuned in a manner to mimimize the confidence misclassifications, or in other words loss. Lastly, breakthroughs in functions (called **activation functions**) that could be used to replace the non-differentiable, 0-derivative step function (-1 if wrong, +1 if right) the perceptron was using were also introduced, which was the final piece in creating a differentiable network able to be trained to minimize the loss. All of these together created the framework for the Artificial Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of activation functions\n",
    "\n",
    " Some of the activation functions mentioned are: \n",
    "   - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), a function x that is 0 when $x\\leq0$\n",
    "   - $\\tanh$, used to create some value in between -1 and 1\n",
    "   - sigmoid, usually used to model some probability, giving a value of 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    " They can be defined as the following, with their derivatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\operatorname{ReLU}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "x, & \\text{if } x \\geq 0, \\\\\n",
    "0, & \\text{if } x < 0.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\operatorname{ReLU'}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1, & \\text{if } x \\geq 0, \\\\\n",
    "0, & \\text{if } x < 0.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tanh(x) = \\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tanh'(x) = 1 - (\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}})^2 = 1 - \\tanh^2(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "sigmoid(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \\text{. Note that this is commonly denoted as } \\sigma(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "sigmoid'(x) = 1 - \\frac{e^{-x}}{(1+e^{-x})^2} = (\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}})(1-\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}) = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  - **Note:** For sigmoid, due to the nature of the loss function it is usually good practice to ensure that values never go past ($1*10^{-8},1-1*10^{-8}$). This is called clipping, and ensures your super confident features don't diverge to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these can be used to replace the perceptron loss. **However, do note that for stable convergence it is highly recommended that you only use one type of activation and it's respective derivative for your entire network. This guarantees better convergence, and I tested this. Mixing activations just suck, you can try it yourself with my own [custom-implemented neural network](https://github.com/PatrickErickson4/FullyModularNumpyArtificialNeuralNetwork).** There are also many other types of activations, but for the sake of this demonstration, we will be working with these activations. If you want to get more into the math and look at the graphs for these functions, you can find it [here](####Derivatives-for-the-activation-functions). \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Fun Fact:** Something interesting of note is that ReLU is piecewise, so you might be wondering how this is differentiable for backpropagation. Well, the secret lies in being able to see which features were activated on unactivated by relu. Since we define that if $x=0$, then the derivative will also be zero, we fix the nondifferentiability issue. Secondly, x will just be 1, which preserves information. Meanwhile the step function is either -1 or 1, with nothing with respect to x. This gives us 0 for the entire function, giving us no meaningful information for backpropagation."

    "There are also loss functions that assign some sort of non-discrete confidence of each prediction, in order to continue with the theme of differentiability for backpropagation. These are found at the end of the Neural Networks, commonly referred to as the \"head\". It is common to use softmax for classification problems. Softmax assignes a probability of confidence to each of the different categories for our problem, which we can then pick the highest in order to classify our problem. For example, if we have 3 categories, those being good, neutral, or bad, the number 1 will be split across all 3 of these categories based on the confidence for each prediction. There is also Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression, which is the exact same formula used in that of linear regression.

Like the activation functions, there are also many different kinds of loss functions, especially for regression, but for the time being we will be sticking with these, as they are the most common.

Let's say we want to predict the number 3. The idea is that the number produced for our model for the category of 3 will be a lot higher than the rest of the categories. What softmax does is it takes into account the values going into that specific category and divides it by the values of all the other categories to get a probability distribution for each category. If we look at the example, we can calculate the probability of us correctly picking 3 as such:\n",
    "$$\\frac{e^{x_3}}{e^{x_0}+e^{x_1}+e^{x_2}+e^{x_3}+e^{x_4}+e^{x_5}+e^{x_6}+e^{x_7}+e^{x_8}+e^{x_9}}$$\n",

    "$$p_i = \\frac{e^{x_3}}{\\sum_{i=0, 3\\in \\text{ the set of integers from 0-9 }}^Ke^{x_i}}$$\n",

This is the core idea behind deep learning: we can approximate almost any function, given enough layers and nodes.

The idea behind sparsification: that a neural network only trains the nodes it needs to, and you can effectively prune these other nodes. The idea behind it therefore is that the more nodes you add, the more likely you are to find a solution that is really good at approximating something, because there are more routes that weights can travel through. Despite this, your model can still overfit if you have too many nodes, so keep that in mind."

We are blind, which means we want to take a \"step\" in the direction in which we decrease loss. Since the point with the smallest loss means we get the best prediction, the intuition is that **we can change the weightss with respect to the change in loss in the negative direction to take a step towards this minima,** until we reach the minima.

    "While in theory backpropagation might make sense, this is generally one of the hardest concepts to grasp the neural network. This is because backpropagation compounds on the fact that in order to calulate the gradient of the weights, (which is a weight matrix, as we had shown in forward pass), we have to chain the derivatives of the loss with the activations and pre-activaations to be able to get the corresponding weight gradient. For example, let's look at the following example:"
